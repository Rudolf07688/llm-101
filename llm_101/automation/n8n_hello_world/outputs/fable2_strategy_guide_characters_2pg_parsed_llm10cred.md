# MAJOR PLAYERS

## Lord Lucien

Lord Lucien was the wealthiest man in Bowerstone and a man everyone looked up to. That is, until his wife and daughter died tragically. Consumed by misery, Lucien threw himself into researching the Old Kingdom, and the citizenry stopped seeing him outside the castle walls. He was a man who many respected, but as he began to decipher the ancient Spire's secrets, his mind grew twisted and grief became madness. He's gone hopelessly mad and now poses a threat to Albion not seen in millennia.

## Theresa

Little is known about this mysterious gypsy woman, other than she alone seems to understand how to stop Lucien's plan for world domination. She was there that day in Old Town to convince Rose to buy the music box and she was there to nurse you through your injuries in the days that followed. Theresa rarely ventures outside the Chamber of Fate in the Guild Cave, but her powers and your possession of the Bower Lake Tomb Seal allow her to communicate with you wherever you go. Whether or not she can fully be trusted is something you'll have to take a chance on.

## Hammer

Sister Hannah is a member of the pacifist monks at the Temple of Light in Oakfield, but has within her deep reserves of strength. Her large stature has led many of the others at the Temple of Light to mockingly call her Hammer, a name she bristles at, but unbeknownst to her, history may indeed have a need for her muscles just yet. When she isn't daydreaming about a glorious life as a warrior, she can be found touring Albion's many pubs.

## Garth

Garth is perhaps the most advanced Will user in all of Albion, a trait that has forced him to seek out a life of solitude in Brightwood Tower. Unfortunately for Garth, people just aren't used to seeing magic anymore and tend to be fearful of any sudden outbursts of powers outside the realm of their simple ways of understanding. Garth's very existence is only a rumor to most people and he intends to keep it that way.

## Reaver

Reaver's abilities with a pistol are as legendary as his ego is large. He's a man of grand claims and even bolder actions and makes no effort to hide either while living a life of luxury in a mansion in Bloodstone. Always looking for the path of least resistance through life, Reaver will do anything to make a quick bundle of gold. He thinks nothing of shooting someone in cold blood if they cross himâ€”or if he's just mildly perturbed. Take care when dealing with him.
